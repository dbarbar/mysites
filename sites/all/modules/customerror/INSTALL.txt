Requirements:
-------------
This module requires drupal 4.5.x or greater.

Installation:
-------------
1. Copy the customerror.module to the Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Patching Drupal core for proper redirection

  This step is required if you want an unlogged user to be redirected
  to the page they are trying to access after they login.

  Copy the patches/common.inc file that corresponds to your Drupal
  version to includes/common.inc.

  For example, if you are running 4.6.3, then copy common.inc.4.6.3
  to includes/common.inc

3. Go to administer->modules
   - Enable the customerror module, click on Save

4. Configure the module:
   - Go to administer->settings->customerror
   - Enter any title and description you want for the 404 (not found)
     and 403 (access denied) pages.
   - You can use any HTML tags to format the text.

5. Enable the customerror pages.
   Go to administer->settings
   - Set "Default 403 (access denied) page:" to "customerror/403" (without
     the quotes).
   - Set "Default 404 (not found) page:" to "customerror/404" (without
     the quotes).
   - Click Save

6. Test your error pages.
   - Copy your present admin page url.
   - Try to go to a non-existent Drupal page on your site.
   You should see your custom error page for 404 (not found) page.

   - Log out from your site.
   - Paste the admin page url and try to go there.
   You should see your custom error page for 403 (access denied) page.
