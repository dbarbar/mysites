**Description:
The pathauto module provides support functions for other modules to 
automatically generate aliases based on appropriate criteria, with a 
central settings path for site administrators.

Implementations are provided for core content types: nodes, taxonomy 
terms, users, blogs, and events.

**Benefits:

Besides making the page address more reflective of its content than
"node/138", it's important to know that modern search engines give 
heavy weight to search terms which appear in a page's URL. By 
automatically using keywords based directly on the page content in the URL, 
relevant search engine hits for your page can be significantly
enhanced.


**Installation AND Upgrades:
See the INSTALL.txt - especially step 4.

**Notice

Please bear in mind that only URLs passed through Drupal's l() or url()
functions will be replaced with their aliases during page output. If a module
or your template contains hardcoded links, such as 'href="node/$node->nid"'
those won't get replaced with their corresponding aliases. Use instead

* 'href="'. url("node/$node->nid") .'"' or
* l("Your link title", "node/$node->nid")

See http://api.drupal.org/api/HEAD/function/url and 
http://api.drupal.org/api/HEAD/function/l for more information.
